Rules:          
-  Standard 15x15 board with 100 tiles
-  2 player game
-  Players alternate taking turns. Each turn, a player may either:
    o	place tiles on the board,
    o	exchange (discard) tiles 
    o	or pass (do nothing)
-  The player who places the first word must ensure that it passes through the centre tile 
    of the board
-  Once a player has decided to play a word, they are only able to play a word or skip. 
    Swapping of tiles is prohibited.

Placing Tiles:
-  When placing tiles on the board, all tiles must spell one main word of at least two letters, 
    reading horizontally from left to right or vertically from top to bottom.
-  Blank tiles are denoted by '#' in this version of the game. When playing a blank tile onto the 
    board, player must designate its letter value by choosing an appropriate letter.
-  The word must touch existing words either horizontally or vertically.
-  When the main word makes additional cross-words, they are each considered to be part of 
    the play for the purposes of scoring the play and determining its validity.

Exchanging Tiles & Passing:
-  Player may also choose to either exchange their tiles or pass. Both will result in a score of 
   zero for the turn.
-  Player may exchange one or more of his/her tiles for new tiles from the tile bag, as long as 
   there are at least seven tiles in the bag. The new tiles drawn from the bag will be displayed 
    in player's subsequent turn.

End of Turn & Point System:
-  At the end of a player's turn, the player's cumulative score will be calculated and enough tiles
    will be drawn to bring the player's total back to seven tiles (if possible). 
-  The score of a word is the sum of the scores of its letters, each multiplied according to any letter
    bonus squares newly covered, then finally multiplied according to any word bonus squares 
    newly covered. (The center square counts as a double word square.) 
-  Each tile has a fixed point as follows:
    o	0pts Blank '#' 				(2 Tiles)
    o	1pt A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, U	(9 A, 12 E, 9 I, 4 L, 6 N, 8 O, 6 R, 4 S, 6 T, 4 U)
    o	2pts D, G				(4 D, 3 G)
    o	3pts B, C, M, P				(2 Tiles each)
    o	4pts F, H, V, W, Y			(2 Tiles each)
    o	5pts K					(1 Tile each)
    o	8pts J, X				(1 Tile each)
    o	10pts Q, Z				(1 Tile each)
-  The score of the play is the sum of the scores of its words, plus a 50-point 'bingo' bonus if 
    all seven tiles are used

Winning the Game:
-  The game automatically ends when one player has successfully played all of his/her tiles, and 
    all 100 tiles have been drawn.
-  The game may also be manually concluded when either player chooses to end the game
-  The winner is the player who has scored the most points at the end of the game.
